If there is some reason you cannot create an account, please email your feedback about the web site to Dan York at [york@isoc.org](mailto:york@isoc.org).

The feedback we seek right now includes questions such as:

* Does the overall design work for you in your region?
* Do you have any comments about what you see so far?

With the migration of such a massive site as ours, there are inevitably a range of issues after the launch of the new site.
Known issues include:

* There are still broken links pointing to older content. We are working through our list changing links and setting up redirections.
    * This is unfortunately true in particular for the Deploy360 site where had some import challenges that broke a number of the links.
* We are still in the process of migrating some content from the old site, including:
    * Older Board of Trustees minutes, agenda and meeting notices.
    * Past Beyond The Net grant recipients.
    * A couple of our online tutorials.
    * Internet Governance timeline (/igtimeline)
    * History of the Internet Society
* The Spanish and French versions of the site still need some pages translated from English. 
* The donation form and several other registration forms are hosted on a separate site.

All those issues and many more are currently being worked on by the ISOC website editorial team.

We welcome all your feedback as we engage in this exciting project of defining a new ISOC website!
