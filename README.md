# Internet Society Beta Site
The Internet Society is developing a new website and is running a public open "beta" site visible to all at:

https://beta.internetsociety.org/

**IF YOU HAVE FEEDBACK ABOUT THE BETA SITE** please open an issue here (but please read below first):

https://github.com/InternetSociety/beta-site-feedback/issues

You will need a (free) Github account in order to create an issue or respond to other issues. [You can create an account on Github](https://github.com/join) or sign in with your existing Github account. If there is some reason you cannot create an account, please email your feedback about the beta site to Dan York at [york@isoc.org](mailto:york@isoc.org).

Please be aware that the beta site will be going through a series of development phases and that we will be seeking different types of feedback at different times. Updates will be made on a regular basis from the beta launch in June 2017 until the production launch targeted for September 2017.

## Initial Beta Period - June 4, 2017

In the initial "early beta" phase of the launch, we are providing a view of the new website design and the overall look-and-feel. **Most of the site is INCOMPLETE** and so *most links will not work* and many pages are missing. 

The feedback we seek right now includes questions such as:

* Does the overall design work for you in your region?
* What do you like/dislike about what you see so far?

Many technical aspects of the site will be changing as will much of the content. 

Known issues include:

* Most links do not work.
* Many more pages need to be added.
* The URL structure will change.
* The items in the menus will change slightly as we adjust them.
* Images have not yet been optimized for low-bandwidth connections.
* The mobile interfaces need further development.

This initial beta period is primarily to receive feedback on the overall design direction. We appreciate any thoughts you have on the work so far.

## Future Beta Periods

Over the next weeks and months we will be creating the new content and migrating content from the existing Internet Society website. There will be additional points at which we will be seeking feedback, including:

* **ACCESSIBILITY TESTING** - our site is planned to meet WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines. When ready, we will be seeking testing/feedback on the work we have done.

* **BANDWIDTH TESTING** - we are targeting the site to work over mobile devices on 3G connections. At a point in the development we will be seeking people to help us test how well it works on lower-bandwidth connections.

* **MULTILINGUAL TESTING** - later in July or August we will be bringing on the French and Spanish versions of the site. We will be seeking feedback from the community about how well those versions work in their regions.

* **CONTENT COMPLETE** - as we get to the end of August and early September we will have brought over much of the content and will be seeking feedback on the state of the site.

We will provide updates over the next weeks and months and will let you know when specific feedback is requested.

We welcome all your feedback as we engage in this exciting project of defining a new ISOC website!
