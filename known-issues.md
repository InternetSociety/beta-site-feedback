# Internet Society Website Launch - 14 September 2017

## Known issues

At the time the site goes live on 14 September, we know of the following issues 
(beyond those [listed on the Issues page](https://github.com/InternetSociety/beta-site-feedback/issues) ):

* Global Internet Maps (/map/global-internet-report) will not be part of the initial launch. We are still working to determine how best to support them on the new site.
* Translated content into French and Spanish is lagging behind the English content.
